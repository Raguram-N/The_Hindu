# 📑 Case Study: 
## Personalized Keyword Subscription - The Hindu

---

## 1. Title  
**“How Personalized Keyword Alerts Can Boost *The Hindu’s* Subscriptions & Retention Among Competitive Exam Aspirants”**  

---

## 2. Background  
*The Hindu* is one of India’s most respected newspapers, trusted for its **editorial quality and factual reporting**. Its readership includes a significant base of **students preparing for competitive exams** such as UPSC, TNPSC, SSC, Banking, and NEET.  

In recent years, however, **digital-first platforms** (Google News, Inshorts, coaching apps) have begun capturing this audience by offering **personalized, bite-sized content**. While *The Hindu* remains strong in credibility, the lack of **personalization** has led to reduced engagement and subscription drop-offs.  

---

## 3. Problem  
- **Information Overload:** Aspirants spend 1–2 hours daily filtering relevant news from the paper.  
- **Lack of Personalization:** All subscribers receive the same news package, even though their needs differ (UPSC vs NEET vs Banking).  
- **High Competition:** Coaching centers and news apps provide “ready-made current affairs digests,” luring aspirants away.  
- **Low Retention:** Many students subscribe for 1–2 months but do not renew due to effort required in filtering.  

---

## 4. Proposed Solution – Keyword Subscription Box  
Introduce a **“Keyword Box” feature** during subscription signup:  

- ✅ Readers enter keywords/topics (e.g., *Governor Powers, GST, Environment Acts, Monetary Policy, WHO*).  
- ✅ Aspirants can even paste their **exam syllabus** into the box.  
- ✅ Each day, *The Hindu’s* system automatically scans published articles and:  
  - **Highlights** matched keywords in the e-paper/app.  
  - Sends **personalized notifications or email alerts** with a *“Daily Keyword Digest.”*  
- ✅ Optional: Archive matched articles under a *“My Topics”* dashboard for revision.

The **Keyword/Syllabus-based study model** is already a **100% proven success formula** in India’s exam prep ecosystem.

  - Example: *Toppers underline syllabus topics (like “Federalism,” “Governor Powers,” “Climate Change,” etc.) and connect them with daily news articles for relevance.*  
- **Coaching institutes and current affairs magazines** follow the same model:  
  - *Vision IAS*, *Shankar IAS*, *Drishti*, and others filter news **only through syllabus keywords.**  
  - Lakhs of aspirants pay for this model monthly.
