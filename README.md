## 2. Background  

The Hindu is one of India’s most respected newspapers, trusted for its editorial quality and factual reporting. Its readership includes a significant base of students preparing for competitive exams such as UPSC, TNPSC, SSC, Banking etc.  

In recent years, however:  
- Digital-first platforms (Google News, Inshorts, coaching apps) have begun capturing this audience with personalization.  
- While The Hindu remains strong in credibility, **the lack of personalization has led to reduced engagement and subscription drop-offs.**

**Picture this**

 One morning, a young aspirant preparing for UPSC opened **five different news apps** just to find one thing:  
> **“Any news related to India’s foreign policy and Tamil Nadu politics.”**

He struggled with:  
- Endless scrolling through irrelevant headlines  
- Bookmarking, screenshots, and messy notes  
- Missing key updates buried under noise  

The frustration grew:  

- *“Why can’t I just follow the keywords that matter to me?”*  
- *“Why isn’t the news experience as personal as my exam syllabus or profession?”*  

For The Hindu, this resulted in:
- **Low retention:** Students subscribe for 1–2 months and don’t renew
- **Missed monetisation:** Same content experience for casual readers and serious aspirants

That’s when the spark struck:  
👉  Instead of making readers adjust to the newspaper, **let the newspaper adjust to the reader.**  

A problem turned into a product:  
⚡ **The Hindu – Personalized Keyword Subscription: Read what matters to you.**   

---

## 3. Problem  

- **Information Overload:** Aspirants spend 1–2 hours daily filtering relevant news.  
- **Lack of Personalization:** All subscribers receive the same news package.  
- **High Competition:** Coaching centers and apps provide “ready-made digests.”  
- **Low Retention:** Students often subscribe for 1–2 months but don’t renew.

## 4. Proposed Solution – Keyword Subscription Box

<td width="60%" valign="top">

**Keyword Subscription Box**

Introduce a **“Keyword Box”** feature during subscription signup:  

✅ Readers enter keywords/topics (e.g., Governor Powers, GST, Environment Acts, Monetary Policy, WHO).  
✅ Aspirants can even paste their exam syllabus into the box.  
✅ Each day, The Hindu’s system automatically scans published articles and:  
- Highlights matched keywords in the e-paper/app.  
- Sends personalized notifications or email alerts with a **Daily Keyword Digest.**  
✅ Optional: Archive matched articles under a **“My Topics” dashboard** for revision.
