# 📰 Personalized Keyword Subscription – The Hindu  
“How Personalized Keyword Alerts Can Boost The Hindu’s Subscriptions & Retention Among Competitive Exam Aspirants”  

---

## 1. Overview  
The Hindu – Personalized Keyword Subscription is a proposed feature designed to:  

- Let readers **subscribe to specific keywords/topics** they care about  
- Deliver a **daily curated feed or digest** filtered by those topics  
- Send **breaking news alerts** tied to chosen keywords  
- Provide a **noise-free, reader-first experience**  
- Reposition The Hindu as the **most trusted current affairs partner** for exam aspirants  

---

## ✨ The Story – The Spark  

> One morning, a young aspirant preparing for UPSC opened **five different news apps** just to find one thing:  
> *“Any news related to India’s foreign policy and Tamil Nadu politics.”*  

He struggled with:  
- Endless scrolling through irrelevant headlines  
- Bookmarking, screenshots, and messy notes  
- Missing key updates buried under noise  

The frustration grew:  

- *“Why can’t I just follow the keywords that matter to me?”*  
- *“Why isn’t the news experience as personal as my exam syllabus or profession?”*  

👉 That’s when the spark struck:  
Instead of making readers adjust to the newspaper, **let the newspaper adjust to the reader.**  

⚡ A problem turned into a product:  
**The Hindu – Personalized Keyword Subscription: Read what matters to you.**

## 2. Background  

The Hindu is one of India’s most respected newspapers, trusted for its editorial quality and factual reporting. Its readership includes a significant base of students preparing for competitive exams such as UPSC, TNPSC, SSC, Banking, and NEET.  

In recent years, however:  
- Digital-first platforms (Google News, Inshorts, coaching apps) have begun capturing this audience with personalization.  
- While The Hindu remains strong in credibility, **the lack of personalization has led to reduced engagement and subscription drop-offs.**  

---

## 3. Problem  

- **Information Overload:** Aspirants spend 1–2 hours daily filtering relevant news.  
- **Lack of Personalization:** All subscribers receive the same news package.  
- **High Competition:** Coaching centers and apps provide “ready-made digests.”  
- **Low Retention:** Students often subscribe for 1–2 months but don’t renew.

## 4. Proposed Solution – Keyword Subscription Box  

Introduce a **“Keyword Box”** feature during subscription signup:  

✅ Readers enter keywords/topics (e.g., Governor Powers, GST, Environment Acts, Monetary Policy, WHO).  
✅ Aspirants can even paste their exam syllabus into the box.  
✅ Each day, The Hindu’s system automatically scans published articles and:  
- Highlights matched keywords in the e-paper/app.  
- Sends personalized notifications or email alerts with a **Daily Keyword Digest.**  
✅ Optional: Archive matched articles under a **“My Topics” dashboard** for revision.

3. **Delivery** → Subscriber gets:  
   - Alerts (mobile notification/email).  
   - Highlighted keywords inside the e-paper/app.  
   - A “Matched Articles Only” view.  
4. **Engagement** → Readers spend less time filtering, more time reading.
